# A Brief History
A few moons ago, somebody on r/vba SubReddit asked a question on how to retrieve weather data from meteostat using curl <b>IN VBA</b>...\
I tried to help that person by researching how to VBA can use curl to carry out that task...\

I found that curl is now available in WIN10 after making some changes in Add/Remove windows features...\
From VBA curl could be called using shell but it'd be too easy...so I researched further and found that I can use WinHttpRequest or MSXML2...\

I wrote and tested successfully some code snippets and tried to share the information back to the OP on SubReddit but it turned out that person was asking help regarding his/her homework and that question was deleted by Mods...\

I don't like to let my efforts wasted so here we are...
