# A Brief History
A few moons ago, somebody on [r/vba SubReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/) asked a question on how to retrieve weather data from meteostat using curl <b>IN VBA</b>...\
I tried to help that person by researching how VBA can use curl to carry out that task...

I found that curl is now available in WIN10 17063, or later, after making some changes in Turn Windows features on or off...\
From VBA curl could be called using shell but it'd be too easy...\
So I researched further and found that I can use WinHttpRequest or MSXML2 to create http (get) requests...

I wrote and tested successfully some code snippets and tried to share the information back to the OP on SubReddit but it turned out that this person was asking for help regarding his/her homework and that question was deleted by Mods...

I don't like to let my efforts wasted so here we are...

Kindly head over to [Wiki](https://github.com/NLYinMaung/meteoXL/wiki) for more information...
